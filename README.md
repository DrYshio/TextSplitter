# TextSplitter
A simple program to split docx files into equal parts

The program splits the contents of input.docx into a selected number of roughly equal parts. The paragraph division stays intact, as the split happens at the nearest paragraph break.

If there are 2 or more files in the /text folder (please create it by yourself), the program will merge them into a single merged_output.docx and use it for splitting/
